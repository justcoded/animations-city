Animations give the web-page some liveliness and if they are high-quality animations, you won’t want to leave the page! Animations are the future, constantly developing, making them a staple in web-development.

For that reason we’ve created “Sin City”, a web-page filled with animations which respond to the actions of users. The view of the city has many shifting details, so we chose a template which you’ll notice on the right hand side.
In order to bring this city to life, you’ll need to know a little JavaScript. 🙂
